# shortcut
Quickly make and use shortcuts in your shell for easy navigation

## Installation


### bash

`sh install.sh`

### zsh

`zsh install.zsh`

The installation commands will put an executable `shortcut` in `/usr/local/bin`, and append a shell function called `sc` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, respectively.

## Example usage

Say you're in `~/some/long/path/work`:

  `sc work .`  to declare a shortcut called work that leads to the current dir

  `sc work`  to cd to that shortcut.

(Of course, when you declare a shortcut you can also use an absolute path if you want, like `sc go /home/me/go/src/github.com/me`)

The shortcuts are persistent, and are stored in `~/.scrc`

## Fuzzy finding shortcuts 

You can integrate fuzzy finding with your shortcuts via the ~/.scrc file. 

Use this example to integrate with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

`alias scf='sc $(cut -d " " -f 1  ~/.scrc | fzf)'`
